## Sentiment-Analysis-of-John-Wick-4

## INTRODUCTION
After John Wick Chapter 3, there was so much anticipation for the release of John Wick Chapter 4 and it premiered at the Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on March 6, 2023, and was released in the United States on March 24. Having been a fan of the movie I was thrilled with the release of John Wick Chapter 4, and I decided to perform a sentiment analysis to show what other viewers think of the movie.
This analysis enabled me to learn more about Data Mining and the use of the Natural Language Processing Tool Kit to draw out meanings from textual data.

## AIM OF THE ANALYSIS
This analysis was done to show viewersâ€™ perceptions of the movie. I decided to carry out this analysis to find out the most common words used in the reviews, and the months and days with the highest rating.
